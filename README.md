## Intro
---
Tindie is a project based on a simple issue - Finding new games! The intention is for it to be basically Tinder for Indie games (/pretty much any game on Steam!)

It is built off of my [Steam Rolled API](https://github.com/DanMossDev/Steam-Rolled/) and is currently in a very basic stage.

Currently you can choose YES or NO as to whether you like the look of a game, this will add it to your list of matches which can be saved between sessions if you login beforehand - currently it does not automatically add matches made before logging in to your stored data, this will be added in future.

If you are logged in, you will never see a duplicate - and you will never see a duplicate in a single session even if you aren't logged in.

### Plans for the future
---
I intend to build out this project until such a point as there is a basic algorithm to favour showing the user more games similar to those they have liked, and fewer similar to those they disliked.

Add ability to filter by language, genre, maybe some other stuff - already basically implemented on the API side just need to let the user actually do it.

<br>
Right now it just uses vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, but down the line I might well convert it to a React project or maybe a Next.JS project.

### Final Word
---
Thanks for checking out Tindie, feel free to have a play around with the version on Pages, currently it will just offer you random games and store them only for your current session.
