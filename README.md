## Intro
---
Tindie is a project based on a simple issue - Finding new games! The intention is for it to be basically Tinder for Indie games (/pretty much any game on Steam!)

It is built off of my [Steam Rolled API](https://github.com/DanMossDev/Steam-Rolled/) and is currently in a very basic stage.

<br>

### Plans for the future
---
I intend to build out this project until such a point as there is user auth, persistent memory of which games a user has seen, liked, disliked, etc. - and implementation of a basic algorithm to favour showing them more games similar to those they have liked, and fewer similar to those they disliked.

<br>
Right now it just uses vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, but down the line I might well convert it to a React project or maybe a Next.JS project.

<br>

### Final Word
---
Thanks for checking out Tindie, feel free to have a play around with the version on Pages, currently it will just offer you random games and store them only for your current session.
